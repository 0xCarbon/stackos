  "GOVERNANCE_EXPLAIN_DESCRIPTION": "By becoming a governor, community members can actively participate in governing the StackOS protocol. There are two types of governors depending on the number of tokens staked: Node Apprentice and Node Authority.<br />What type of governor you are determines the voting power on nodes, burn rates per resource purchase transaction, marketing actions and other network matter, and determines also the height of annual yield in the governor pool.<br />Governors will play a fundamental role in the StackOS protocol and its to be released DAO.<br />Community members actively governing will receive annual yield and a share of profit from the usage of the cloud in STACK!",

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
